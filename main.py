    The main entry point of this bot is `forecast_on_tournament` in the parent class.
    See the script at the bottom of the file for more details on how to run the bot.
    Ignoring the finer details, the general flow is:
    - Load questions from Metaculus
    - For each question
        - Execute run_research a number of times equal to research_reports_per_question
        - Execute respective run_forecast function `predictions_per_research_report * research_reports_per_question` times
        - Aggregate the predictions
        - Submit prediction (if publish_reports_to_metaculus is True)
    - Return a list of ForecastReport objects

    Only the research and forecast functions need to be implemented in ForecastBot subclasses.

            Important tips: 
            - Your 20th percentile forecast should be greater than the lower bound of {question.lower_bound}.
            - Your 80th percentile forecast should be less than the upper bound of {question.upper_bound}.
            - Have a wide range for your tails since you might not have all the information, or might be misunderstanding something.
            - Historically your 10th and 90th percentiles have been far too narrow. Try to be more calibrated by making them twice as wide as you think is necessary.
            - Like a good forecaster use your own judgment!
