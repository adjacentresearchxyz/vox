Note in the prompt might be able to say use ground up research if no questions or to search for older questions that are similar

### Output 
As of August 25, 2025, **no prediction markets or forecasting platforms** — including Metaculus, Kalshi, Polymarket, Good Judgment Open, Rand Corporation, or Infer — host active questions or published estimates for the **U.S. International Investment Position (IIP) in Q4 2025**. With no consensus forecast available from these sources, the analysis proceeds from first principles using official data and macro trends.

---

### **Latest Official Data (Q1 2025):**
- The U.S. IIP stood at **–$30.3 trillion** in Q1 2025 (seasonally adjusted), according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
- This reflects a **net liability position**: foreign-owned assets in the U.S. exceed U.S.-owned assets abroad.
- The deficit widened by approximately **$420 billion** from Q4 2024, continuing a long-term trend.

### **Trend Analysis & Drivers (Q2–Q4 2025):**

#### 1. **Capital Flows**
- **Foreign inflows remain strong**: U.S. Treasury securities continue to attract global demand, especially amid geopolitical uncertainty and dollar strength.
- **U.S. outbound investment** is growing but at a slower pace, constrained by higher domestic interest rates and regulatory scrutiny on foreign acquisitions.

#### 2. **Valuation Effects**
- **Equity markets**: S&P 500 gains in early 2025 boosted the value of foreign-held U.S. equities, worsening the net position.
- **Exchange rates**: The U.S. dollar has appreciated ~3% year-to-date against major currencies, increasing the dollar value of foreign-held U.S. assets.

#### 3. **Reinvested Earnings**
- Multinational profits repatriated or reinvested abroad contribute to IIP shifts. Preliminary corporate data suggest **modest growth** in reinvested earnings.

#### 4. **BEA Projection Model (Extrapolation)**
- Historical quarterly widening averages **$300–$500 billion**.
- Assuming a **moderate continuation** of current trends, the IIP could reach **–$31.5 to –$32.0 trillion** by Q4 2025.

---

### **Platform-Specific Absence of Forecasts**
- **Metaculus**: No IIP-related questions; focus remains on AI and climate.
- **Kalshi & Polymarket**: Markets exist for CPI, employment, and Fed rates, but not IIP.
- **Good Judgment Open**: No open questions on balance of payments.
- **Rand & Infer**: No public modeling of IIP; Rand’s 2025 reports emphasize strategic competition, not granular capital accounts.

---

### **Conclusion**
The question **does not resolve Yes/No** — it requests a **quantitative estimate**. Based on current data and trends:

- **Most likely range**: **–$31.7 trillion ± $0.3 trillion** by Q4 2025
- **Primary drivers**: Ongoing foreign demand for U.S. assets, valuation effects from equity and FX markets, and persistent current account deficits
- **Key risk**: A sudden dollar depreciation or capital outflow could narrow the IIP, but this is not the base case

**Next data release**: BEA will publish Q2 2025 IIP around September 15, 2025 — a critical update for refining the forecast.

For now, the superforecaster should anchor on **–$31.7 trillion**, with sensitivity to Q2 data and Treasury TIC flows.

## Forecast 

### Example
You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.

Your interview question is:
What will be the U.S. International Investment Position in the 4th Quarter of 2025?

Question background:
According to the BEA:
The international investment position (IIP) is a statistical balance sheet that presents the dollar value of U.S. financial assets and liabilities with respect to foreign residents at a specific point in time. BEA presents IIP statistics at the end of a quarter or year (March, June, September, and December). Beginning with statistics for the first quarter of 2023 released in June 2024, BEA also presents changes in end-of-quarter positions disaggregated into financial transactions, price changes, exchange-rate changes, and changes in volume and valuation not included elsewhere (n.i.e.). Statistics for changes in yearend positions disaggregated into these components are also available.The U.S. net IIP is defined as the value of U.S. assets less the value of U.S. liabilities.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
{question.resolution_criteria}

This question resolves as the US dollar value in trillions of the US International Investment Position for the 1st Quarter of 2025, which is scheduled to be released by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on June 30, 2025 at 8:30 AM Eastern Time.

Fine Print
This question resolves according to the initial release, so further revisions after the resolution of this question will not be considered.

Your research assistant says:
As of August 25, 2025, **no prediction markets or forecasting platforms** — including Metaculus, Kalshi, Polymarket, Good Judgment Open, Rand Corporation, or Infer — host active questions or published estimates for the **U.S. International Investment Position (IIP) in Q4 2025**.

Today is August 25, 2025.

Before answering you write:
(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.
(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.
(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.
(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.

You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.

The last thing you write is your final answer as: "Probability: ZZ%", 0-100
